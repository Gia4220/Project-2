 <p>For many people, the thought of playing video games as a full-time job on YouTube or Twitch might seem like a far-off dream, akin to becoming a rockstar or professional athlete.</p>

 <p>For others, the very concept of a career reliant on video views and channel subscriptions, like so many "social media influencer," might seem like a quick jaunt down easy street for lazy millennials who don't want to get real jobs.</p>

 <p>All this to say: There are a lot of myths and skepticism around what it means to play video games on the internet for a living in this day and age.</p>

 <p>But, like any career path, the stories and experiences among the people who make money from YouTube and Twitch are extremely varied. From the types of games they play on-camera to the amount of money they make is unique to each person; no one content creator is indicative of the success of the next. That said, there are definitely some common themes in their stories.</p>

 <p>Tied with Logan Paul for fourth pace on 2017's list is Mark Fischbach (a.k.a. "Markiplier"), who reportedly made $12.5 million last year. Markiplier currently has 19 million subscribers, and is most famous for his commentary during various horror video games, including the "Five Nights at Freddy's" series.</p>

 <p>Fischbach's channel says he's also raised over $3 million for various charities, including the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, through various livestreaming events and drives during his six years on YouTube. </p>

 <p>When asked how his life has changed since he achieved internet fame, Fischbach admitted, "Fundamentally, [my life is] not that different than the life I was living before, as I'm still spending the vast majority of my time at home in front of a computer," Fischbach told us.</p>

 <p>He did say, though, that playing games on YouTube has changed his general perspective.</p>

 <p>"Your horizons expand tremendously when you realize that millions of people are watching what you make," he said. "It's created a very strong sense of purpose for me and pushes me to constantly improve myself to meet ever-growing expectations."</p>

 <p>The constant demand for new and well-produced video content is one of the most prevalent challenges across all branches of digital media, and is especially difficult for independent content creators, who do much of their filming and editing on their own.</p>

 <p>When asked about his daily routine, a VR streamer with more than 140 thousand subscribers who goes by the screen name "Nagzz21" described a hectic schedule that prioritizes much of his time to spending time with his audience: </p>

 <p>The mornings usually consist of trying to get to the messages many have left me via social media, Discord, as well as [YouTube] comments. It is almost impossible now to respond to every single one as I have in the past, but reading them all still takes a good chunk of the day.  Since I upload a video every other day, editing takes a big chunk during the middle...On top of the editing and messages, I have to fit in streaming....On top of actually playing a game [outside of streaming live] which can take hours, there are many events the community holds in virtual reality... I am invited to many of these, and I make it a point as best as I can to attend them all.  Then factor in the other streaming I do, with variety games during the week for live viewers, and I have barely enough time to go get a coffee around the corner for a little fresh air! </p>

 <p>Some channels and personalities must rely on backing from separate groups or larger companies, like Rooster Teeth, the Austin-based digital media company that makes animated shows, feature-length films and supports a whole array of YouTube channels dedicated to video gameplay.</p>

 <p>“Not having enough time in the day to do everything you want to do can be really frustrating" says Lindsay Jones, a voice actor and cast member at Rooster Teeth's flagship gameplay channel, "Achievement Hunter."</p>

 <p>There are only so many games and ways to play them, and one of the biggest concerns among gaming content creators is the constant need to "one-up" their previous works and make videos that are continuously bigger and better than before. </p>

 <p>"You have to keep churning out bigger and better things lest you fall behind in the perpetual race to stay relevant," Fischbach said.</p>

 <p>"With these platforms, viewers want something new, or things to be exciting at all times," Nagzz21 agreed. "Keeping up that trend becomes tiresome and sometimes near impossible."</p>

 <p>YouTube and Twitch, where most professional gamers host the majority of their content, have both made well-meaning (although not always practical) efforts to curb harassment. Just last week, Twitch rolled out a new anti-harassment policy, which tasks the streamer with the responsibility of discouraging abuse in their live chat rooms, and includes a vague dress code that requires streamers to "wear attire that would be publicly appropriate for the context, location, and activity they are broadcasting."</p>

 <p>"The biggest misconception I've seen is that people seem to assume gaming YouTubers or streamers are lazy or have an easy job," Fischbach said. "The only person I have anything to prove to is myself so I'll just keep working hard at something I thoroughly enjoy."</p>

 <p>When asked what is the most rewarding aspect of playing video games professionally on YouTube and Twitch, the gamers I spoke with unanimously agreed that their audiences are what make the challenges worth while — and they all seem to genuinely love their jobs.</p>

 <p>"It was never about the money, and still isn't nor will it ever be," Nagzz21 said. "I am now however blessed to be able to do this for a living, and I wake up every day grateful and will never take it for granted."</p>
